Alright I need five classes since there are 5 things going on at one time.

I need two 'people' to make this transaction:

a User (the person with the account)
an institution like a Bank (by legal definition a Bank is considered a 'person' (LLC, Inc, Co, are all people, companies are people)

Alright so I have:
User
Bank

The User has an:
Account

This is called a transaction so I'll probably have a transaction class:
Transaction

And since this transaction will be automated I'll probably need an ATM class:
ATM

Alright so my classes will be:

User

Bank

Account

Transaction

ATM
